### onERC1155BatchReceived

```solidity
function onERC1155BatchReceived(address operator, address from, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values, bytes data) external pure returns (bytes4)
```



*Handles the receipt of a multiple ERC1155 token types. This function is called at the end of a `safeBatchTransferFrom` after the balances have been updated. NOTE: To accept the transfer(s), this must return `bytes4(keccak256(&quot;onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)&quot;))` (i.e. 0xbc197c81, or its own function selector).*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| operator | address | The address which initiated the batch transfer (i.e. msg.sender) |
| from | address | The address which previously owned the token |
| ids | uint256[] | An array containing ids of each token being transferred (order and length must match values array) |
| values | uint256[] | An array containing amounts of each token being transferred (order and length must match ids array) |
| data | bytes | Additional data with no specified format |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes4 | `bytes4(keccak256(&quot;onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)&quot;))` if transfer is allowed |

### onERC1155Received

```solidity
function onERC1155Received(address operator, address from, uint256 id, uint256 value, bytes data) external pure returns (bytes4)
```



*Handles the receipt of a single ERC1155 token type. This function is called at the end of a `safeTransferFrom` after the balance has been updated. NOTE: To accept the transfer, this must return `bytes4(keccak256(&quot;onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)&quot;))` (i.e. 0xf23a6e61, or its own function selector).*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| operator | address | The address which initiated the transfer (i.e. msg.sender) |
| from | address | The address which previously owned the token |
| id | uint256 | The ID of the token being transferred |
| value | uint256 | The amount of tokens being transferred |
| data | bytes | Additional data with no specified format |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes4 | `bytes4(keccak256(&quot;onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)&quot;))` if transfer is allowed |

### owner

```solidity
function owner() external view returns (address)
```



*Returns the address of the current owner.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined |

### pause

```solidity
function pause() external nonpayable
```






### paused

```solidity
function paused() external view returns (bool)
```



*Returns true if the contract is paused, and false otherwise.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### renounceOwnership

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() external nonpayable
```



*Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call `onlyOwner` functions anymore. Can only be called by the current owner. NOTE: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.*


### startMining

```solidity
function startMining(uint256 toolId, address user, uint256[] resourcesAmount, uint256[] artifactsAmount) external nonpayable
```





#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| toolId | uint256 | undefined |
| user | address | undefined |
| resourcesAmount | uint256[] | undefined |
| artifactsAmount | uint256[] | undefined |

### supportsInterface

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external pure returns (bool)
```



*Returns true if this contract implements the interface defined by `interfaceId`. See the corresponding https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165#how-interfaces-are-identified[EIP section] to learn more about how these ids are created. This function call must use less than 30 000 gas.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| interfaceId | bytes4 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### transferOwnership

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external nonpayable
```



*Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`). Can only be called by the current owner.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newOwner | address | undefined |
